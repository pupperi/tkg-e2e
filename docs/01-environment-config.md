# Setup Environment Specific Params Yaml

Setup a local params file containing all the environment specific values for the e2e demo.  This is distinct from the params file you used for the `tkg-lab`.  Below is a redacted version of the file I used and I placed it in `/local-config/values.yaml` which is referenced in the `.gitignore`.

>Note: for the kubeconfig references below, I used the following approach to get single line json...

```bash
# Set your context to the build server context, then...
kubectl config view --flatten --minify | yq read - --tojson
# Set your context to the app server context, then...
kubectl config view --flatten --minify | yq read - --tojson
```

```yaml
#@data/values
---
petclinic:
  host: petclinic.ironislands.tkg-vsphere-lab.winterfell.live # Ingress host for your app
  image: harbor.stormsend.tkg-vsphere-lab.winterfell.live/petclinic/spring-petclinic # image, includes your harbor domain and project
